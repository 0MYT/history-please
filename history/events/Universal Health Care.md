## Universal Health Care
In 1947, Canada saw the beginnings of what is now our universal health care system when Tommy Douglas implimenteted a provincial program in Saskatchewan. 
It took many eyars for the health care system to evolve into what it is today, and in the beginnig, big buisness pushed back, even doctors protested it. 
In fact, in 1960 the entire Canadain Medical Association opposed publically funded health care. They tried to bill exta, refuse schemes, etc. 
Arguably, the most momentous turning point was in 1984 when the Trudeau government introducted the Canada Health Act. 
This created a national strategy for health care and encouraged all provinces to offer the same standard and degrees of health care.
