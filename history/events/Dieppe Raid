The Dieppe Raid, planned under the codename Operation Jubilee, was an Allied attempt to secure a beachead in western europe and probe the possibility of establishing a new front against the Axis powers in 1942. The landings in Dieppe, France were met with fierce German resistance and ultimately the attack  was called off.

Notably, the landing force was largely comprised of Canadian units that were supplemented with British commandos and air power. The raid was ultimately a failure, with more than half of the allied soldiers who landed on the beaches ending up as casualties, while German losses were minimal.

Dieppe served as a demonstration of the disastrous consequences of underestimating the Atlantic seawall that had been established by the Axis. The shortcomings of this raid would come to be a learning experience for future amphibious landings by the Allies, such as the 1943 Sicily landings and the Normandy landings in 1944.
