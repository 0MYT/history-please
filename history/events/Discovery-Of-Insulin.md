> "Insulin is not a cure for diabetes; It is a treatment."        By Dr. Frederick Banting

For years scientists tried to find the key method to prevent diabetes and control normal metabolism. 
Various experiments failed, and it was only until the summer of 1921, a team from University of Toronto, led by Dr. Frederick Banting, discovered insulin in the new experiment. 
Of course, Dr. Frederick Banting and his supervisor, Dr. J.J.R. Macleod, received Noble Prize for their great contribution.

### Fun Facts
- Dr. Frederick Banting had **__zero__ experimental research experience**.
- Dr. Frederick Banting was knighted by King George V and he is the very **last** Canadian knight. 
- Many scholars and historians are questioning if Dr. J.J.R. Macleod deserves the Noble Prize as many believed his research partner, Dr. Charles Best, contributed more.
