# Agnes Macphail
Born in 1890, Agnes Macphail was among the first women to become a politician in early 20th century Canadian history. Most notably, she was the first woman to be elected as a member of the House of Commons. Her platform during her campaigns included:
- rural reforms
- penal reforms
- women's issues

Her involvement with the Progressive Party of Canada is noted, and she was re-elected several times. She later became the first president of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation. Macphail died shortly before she was to be appointed as a Senator
