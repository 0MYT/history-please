# Justin Trudeau
## Prime Minister of Canada
As one of the youngest Prime Ministers elected in Canadian history, Justin Trudeau is a celebrity both in Canada and around the world. 
Despite his opposition, there is no denying Trudeau is a character. 
[Biography] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau)
Born on December 25, 1971, to father, former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, and mother, Margaret Sinclair, Justin spent quite a bit of his early life in Ottawa. Educated initially as a teacher, Trudeau made a transition into politics after leaving his master's degree at McGill in environmental geography.

Rumours circulated in early 2007 that Trudeau would run in a by-election in the Montreal riding of Outremont. The Montreal newspaper La Presse reported despite Trudeau's keenness, Liberal leader Stéphane Dion wanted Outremont for a star candidate who could help rebuild the Liberal Party. Instead, Trudeau announced that he would seek the Liberal nomination in the nearby riding of Papineau for the next general election. The riding, which had once been held for 26 years by André Ouellet, a senior minister under his father, had been in Liberal hands for 53 years before falling to the Bloc Québécois in 2006. Trudeau faced off against Mary Deros, a Montreal city councillor and Basilio Giordano, the publisher of a local Italian-language newspaper for the Liberal nomination. On April 29, 2007, he easily won the party's nomination, picking up 690 votes to 350 for Deros and 220 for Giordano.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper called an election for October 14, 2008, by which time Trudeau had been campaigning for a year in Papineau. On election day Trudeau narrowly defeated Bloc Québécois incumbent Vivian Barbot. Following his election win, Edward Greenspon, editor-in-chief of The Globe and Mail, noted that Trudeau would "be viewed as few other rookie MPs are—as a potential future prime minister—and scrutinized through that lens."
