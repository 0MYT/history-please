## The Tragically Hip
Gord was the lead singer and lyricist of The Tragically Hip. The Canadian rock band was founded in 1983 and became an iconic Candian symbol. While they may not have made international acclaim, their Canadian specifc lylrics influenced Canadian generations to come, inspiring Canadian artists to sing about Canada. As a band, they released 13 studio albums together. 
## Activism
In 2016, Gord, his brother, and the Wenjack family founded the Gord Downie and Chanie Wenjack Fund, which works towards reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. Chanie's story was the centre of Gord's solo album project, _Secret Path_, which was accompanied by a graphic novel.
