- Like many Chinese migrants during the late 1800s, Yip migranted to North America for the gold rush and then stayed in Canada to work on the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). He settled in Vancouver and contributed to the Chinese-Canadian community through entrepreneurship, political activism, and community engagement. However, Yip is not a figure without controversy. His almost monopolistic hold over Vancouver's Chinatown and potential assassination of his rival, David Hung Chang Lew, leave us with complex questions about his methods compared to his ideals.
