Multiculturalism is an political ideology that plays a vital part in Canada. Multiculturalism refers to the presence of people from varying ethnic, religious, and cultural backgrounds. Its official policy was adopted in the 1970s and 1980s by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. This was done in order to place a public emphasis on the importance of immigration in Canadian society. This brought forth the Canadian Multiculturalism Act of 1988 and its eventual addition to the Canadian Constitution Act, 1982 under section 27. Since, multiculturalism has been imperative in shaping Canadian national identity and culture, and known around the world for our diversity and openness.
